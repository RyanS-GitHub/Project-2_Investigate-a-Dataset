# Project: Investigate a Dataset

For this project, the goal was to go through the entire Data Analysis process: Data Wrangling, Data Cleanup, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Students were to conduct their own data analysis and create a file to share that documents their findings. I completed this project in Jupyter Notebook using Python, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy, and Seaborn. This project was open-ended and they were not looking for one right answer, but certain criteria had to be met.

Students were provided with several dataset options to choose from; I chose to analyze the TMDb (The Movie Database) dataset. The dataset contains information on movies from the 1960s through 2015, and includes financial information, ratings, release dates, actors, studios, and more.
